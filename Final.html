            <p><b>What is Computer Science</b></p>
	    <p>Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems, 	encompassing both theoretical foundations and 		    practical applications in solving 	real-world problems.</p>
	    <p><b>First computer</b></p>
	    <p>The first form of a computer is often attributed to Charles Babbage's 	mechanical Difference Engine, developed in the 		    early 19th century, which laid the 	groundwork for modern computing.</p>
	    <p><b>Brainstorming</b></p>
	    <p>Brainstorming is a creative problem-solving technique that involves 	generating a wide range of ideas and solutions in 	    a judgment-free environment.</p>

            <p><b>Hexadecimals Notation</b></p>
            <p>Hexadecimal notation, also known as base-16, is a positional numeral system 	that represents numbers using a radix of 	    sixteen. Unlike the decimal system, which 	uses ten symbols (0-9), hexadecimal uses sixteen distinct symbols: 0-9 and A-F (o   	a-f) to represent values from ten to fifteen. This system is widely used in 	computing and digital electronics because it provides a convenient representation 	of binary-coded values.</p>
            <p><b>Binary</b></p>
	    <p>Binary code is a system of representing text, computer processor 	instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system, typically "0" and "1". 	Each character or instruction is assigned a pattern of binary digits, also known as 	bits. For example, a binary string of eight bits (a byte) can represent any of 256 	possible values.</p>

        <div id="Database" class="section">
            <h2>Database</h2>
          	<p><b>What is a Database</b></p>
		<p>A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and 			accessed electronically. It allows users to efficiently store, retrieve, 		and manage data. Databases are used in a wide range of applications—from 		websites and mobile apps to enterprise systems and scientific research.</p>
		<p><b>Logic Gates</b></p>
		<p>Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital electronics, 		performing operations based on Boolean algebra. They take one or more 			binary inputs (0 or 1) and produce a single binary output. The main types 		are AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.</p>
		<p><b>ER Diagram</b></p>
		<p>An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the 		data model for a system, showing entities, their attributes, and the 			relationships between them. It is widely used in database design to map out 		the logical structure before implementation.</p>
		<p><b>SQL</b></p>
		<p>A relational database is a collection of information that organizes data 		in predefined relationships where data is stored in one or maor tables ( or 		"relations") of columns and rows, making it easy to see and understand how 		different data structures relate to each other</p>

        <div id="Web" class="section">
            <h2>Web</h2>
            <p><b>The world wide web</b></p>
	    <p>The world wide web had its origins in the work of time berners-Lee, who realized the potential of combining internet technology with the concept of linked documents, called hypertext</p>
	    <p><b>Making a website</b></p>
	    <p>We learned how to code a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
	    <p>That is how this website was made</p>

        <div id="Programming" class="section">
            <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p><b>Python coding</b></p>
		<p>Python coding refers to the process of writing computer programs using the Python programming language.

Python is:

High-level – closer to human language than machine code, making it easier to read and write.
Interpreted – code runs directly without a separate compilation step.
Dynamically typed – you don’t need to declare variable types explicitly.
Versatile – supports multiple paradigms: procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>

	<div id="Algorithms" class="section">
		<h2>Algorithms</h2>
		<p><b>What is an Algorithm</b></p>
		<p>An algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, used to
solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.​</p>
		<p><b>Bubble sort</b></p>
		<p>Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent
elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order.​

Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise to the
surface, each element of the array move to the end in each
iteration.​</p>

	<div id="Data Manipulation<" class="section">
		<h2>Data Manipulation</h2>
		<p><b>What is Data Manipulation</b></p>
		<p>Data manipulation refers to the process of organizing, transforming, and modifying raw data to make it more structured, meaningful, and ready for analysis. It is a critical step in data analysis, data mining, and machine learning, enabling users to derive insights and make informed decisions from unstructured or semi-structured data.</p>
		<p><b>Computer Architecture​</b></p>
		<p>A CPU consists of three parts: the arithmetic/logic unit, which contains the circuitry that performs operations on data (such as addition and subtraction); the control unit, which contains the circuitry for coordinating the machine’s activities; and the register unit, which contains data storage cells (like main memory cells), called registers, that are used for temporary storage of information within the CPU.​ </p>

	<div id="Networking" class="section">
		<h2>Networking</h2>
		<p><b>Why do we need networking</b></p>
		<p>The need to share information and resources among different
computers led naturally to linked computer systems, called
networks, in which computers are connected so that data can
be transferred from machine to machine​ </p>
		<p><b>What is a computer network</b></p>
		<p>A data communication system consists of several computerized devices
communicated directly with each other over shared channel plus a S.W
[NOS] to provide services of communications.​</p>

	<div id="AI" class="section">
		<h2>AI</h2>
		<p><b>What is Ai</b></p>
		<p>Artificial intelligence (or AI) is a field in computer science that focuses on solving problems by applying learning techniques (and some math). Ai and the field, in general, focuses on building programs that try 		and imitate the way your own brain works</p>
		<p><b>Turning Test</b></p>
		<p>The Turning test is a test of intelligence in a computer, requiring that a human being should be unable to distinguish the machine from other human being by using the replies to questions put to both</p>
